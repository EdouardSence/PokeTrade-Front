# Pokémon TCG Pocket Trading Website (Frontend)

Welcome to the Pokémon TCG Pocket Trading Website! This project is a frontend application built with React.js that allows users to browse Pokémon TCG cards, list their cards for trade, and find trade matches with other users. The app fetches card data from a local JSON file (mocked API) and provides a seamless user experience for trading Pokémon TCG Pocket cards.

## Features

- Browse Cards: View a list of Pokémon TCG cards with details like name, set, rarity, type, attacks, weaknesses, and retreat costs.
- Search and Filter: Search for specific cards by name.
- Trade Listings: Mark cards as tradable and specify desired cards in return (to be implemented).
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
